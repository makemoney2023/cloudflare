# Agent Swarm Orchestrator

A visual multi-agent workflow builder for Cloudflare Workers. Drag-and-drop agents onto a canvas, connect them into pipelines, and watch them execute live with token-by-token streaming.

## Features

- **Visual Canvas** — Drag-and-drop agent nodes with React Flow
- **6 Agent Types** — Researcher, Writer, Editor, Publisher, Critic, Summarizer
- **Parallel Execution** — Branches run concurrently with topological scheduling
- **Live Streaming** — WebSocket-powered token-by-token output
- **Agent Memory** — Agents remember context across executions
- **Artifact Viewer** — Side panel showing all node outputs
- **Template Workflows** — 8 pre-built pipelines: Blog Post, Research Report, Content Critique, Parallel Research, plus hackathon tracks — Support Triage, Code Review Squad, Startup Pitch Validator, Fact-Check Desk
- **Finalized PDF Reports** — Cover page, run-summary stat cards, results table, full per-agent outputs, execution timeline, and quality checks; backed up to R2
- **MCP Tool Access** — Connect remote MCP servers (Streamable HTTP) via the Plug button; agents call tools in a Reason → Act → Observe loop, with per-agent server selection and live tool badges on the canvas

## MCP Servers

Agents can call tools on any remote MCP server that speaks Streamable HTTP:

1. Click the **Plug** button in the header → **Add server** (name + `https://…/mcp` URL) → **Test URL** to list its tools.
2. Nodes use all configured servers by default; restrict per-agent in the **Selected agent** panel.
3. Templates show which server types they work best with (e.g. Fact-Check Desk → web-search + fetch MCPs).
4. Tool calls stream live over WebSockets, appear as wrench badges on nodes, and are recorded in the PDF report (`via MCP: server/tool`).

No external server handy? Point one at this worker's built-in demo at `/demo-mcp/mcp` (`get_time`, `echo`, `word_count`) to try the loop with zero setup.
- **Cloudflare Native** — Workers AI, Durable Objects, WebSockets, R2

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm --prefix frontend install

# Build the UI, then start the Worker (serves frontend/dist + API)
npm run build:ui
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:8787

## Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy   # builds the UI, then deploys Worker + static assets
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for full guide.
